\section{Introduction}

The need for green energy produces new challenges for the energy industry.
To make green energy sources economically viable, no energy should be wasted.
This is why smart grids are important.
Operating the grid better could save a lot of energy. \cite{Aiello2016}

One of the core problems when operating a smart grid is known as the unit commitment problem
and it was shown to be solved by a quantum computer.
Quantum computers can turn some problems
that are exponentially hard to solve on classical computers
into problems of linear time complexity.
This is also the case with this problem. \cite{Ajagekar2019}

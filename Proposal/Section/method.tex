\section{Method}

In the beginning there will be an explanation of the most important concepts
that are used later in the main part.
These are Smart Grids and the Unit Commitment Problem respectively,
as well as Quantum Computing (Gate-based and Quantum Annealing).\\

In the main part, there will be two approaches:

One practical approach, where Optimizations on real Quantum Computers are executed,
to test the feasability of D-Wave's Quantum Annealer 'Advantage'.

The other will be an theoretical approach, where the feasability of future gate-based Quantum Computers
for practical Optimization Problems is discussed.

\section{Method}

In this Thesis there will be two approaches.

One practical approach, where Optimizations on real Quantum Computers are executed,
to test the feasability of D-Wave's Quantum Annealer 'Advantage'.

The other will be an theoretical approach, where the feasability of future gate-based Quantum Computers
for practical Optimization Problems is discussed.

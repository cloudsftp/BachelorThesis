\section{Research Questions}

The main research question is:
''Is quantum computing advanced enough to tackle practical
smart grid optimization problems?''
The focus will be the ''unit commitment problem.''

This research question can be broken down into more precise questions.
Each question could describe a section of the thesis.
\begin{itemize}
  \item ''How can today's quantum annealers (D-Wave's's 5000 qbit quantum annealer 'Advantage') solve practical unit commitment problems?''
  \item ''How can future gate-based quantum computers (IBM's 1000 qbit quantum computer by 2023) solve practical unit commitment problems?''
\end{itemize}

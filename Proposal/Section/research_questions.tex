\section{Research Questions}

The main research question is:
''Is Quantum Computing advanced enough to tackle practical
Smart Grid Optimization problems?''
Focus will be the ''Unit Commitment Problem.''

This research question can be broken down into more precise questions.
Each question could describe a section of the thesis.
\begin{itemize}
  \item ''What are Smart Grids?'' / ''Motivation for Smart Grids''
  \item ''What is the Unit Commitment Problem?''
  \item ''What is Quantum Computing?''
    / ''Gate-based Quantum Computers vs. Quantum Annealers''
  \item ''Can todays Quantum Annealers (D-Waves's 5000 Qbit Quantum Annealer 'Advantage') solve pratical Unit Commitment Problems?''
  \item ''Can future Gate-based Quantum Computers (IBM's 1000 Qbit Quantum Computer by 2023) solve practical Unit Commitment Problems?''
\end{itemize}

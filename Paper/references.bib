abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the applications of quantum computing to energy systems optimization problems and discuss some of the challenges faced by quantum computers with techniques to overcome them. The basic concepts underlying quantum computation and their distinctive characteristics in comparison to their classical counterparts are also discussed. Along with different hardware architecture description of two commercially available quantum systems, an example making use of open-source software tools is provided as a first step for diving into the new realm of programming quantum computers for solving systems optimization problems. The trade-off between qualities of these two quantum architectures is also discussed. Complex nature of energy systems due to their structure and large number of design and operational constraints make energy systems optimization a hard problem for most available algorithms. Problems like facility location allocation for energy systems infrastructure development, unit commitment of electric power systems operations, and heat exchanger network synthesis which fall under the category of energy systems optimization are solved using both classical algorithms implemented on conventional CPU based computer and quantum algorithm realized on quantum computing hardware. Their designs, implementation and results are stated. Additionally, this paper describes the limitations of state-of-the-art quantum computers and their great potential to impact the field of energy systems optimization.},

@article{Aiello2016,
abstract = {The variable energy sources drive the need for flexibility to restore a system's energy balance. The flexibility sources, i.e. demand side response, dispatchable power plants, storage and interconnection, can respond to restore that balance. Electric vehicles, including plugin EVs and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), have a huge potential to play an important role in future energy systems. EVs and FCEVs can be used to discharge electricity to the grid, and when aggregating the power of a large number of vehicles, they can function as dispatchable power plants. Plugin EVs can adapt their charging behaviour to the needs of the power system operator, and similarly they can act as storage by charging their batteries for example, when there is a surplus of renewable energy. Fuel cell cars (FCEVs), while parked, can produce electricity more efficiently than the present electricity system and with useful 'waste' products, heat and fresh water. In terms of technology, the energy production system " Car as Power Plant " can be envisaged as a fleet of fuel cell vehicles, where cars, while parked (over 90 {\%} of the time), can produce with the fuel cell electricity, heat and fresh water that can be feed into the respective grids. The Car as Power Plant system with FCEVs has the potential to replace all electricity production power plants, creating a flexible detachable decentralized multimodal energy system. This chapter will address the role of electric mobility in the future energy systems in general and its role in demand response and in flexible generation.},

abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) has gained popularity due to its unique capabilities that are quite different from that of classical computers in terms of speed and methods of operations. This paper proposes hybrid models and methods that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of deterministic algorithms and QC techniques to overcome combinatorial complexity for solving large-scale mixed-integer programming problems. Four applications, namely the molecular conformation problem, job-shop scheduling problem, manufacturing cell formation problem, and the vehicle routing problem, are specifically addressed. Large-scale instances of these application problems across multiple scales ranging from molecular design to logistics optimization are computationally challenging for deterministic optimization algorithms on classical computers. To address the computational challenges, hybrid QC-based algorithms are proposed and extensive computational experimental results are presented to demonstrate their applicability and efficiency. The proposed QC-based solution strategies enjoy high computational efficiency in terms of solution quality and computation time, by utilizing the unique features of both classical and quantum computers.},

abstract = {Through its energy and climate policies, the U.S. has set recently a number of ambitious goals (e.g. by 2020 the share of renewable energy sources should increase to 20{\%} of total energy consumption). At the same time the use of RES in the U.S is still significantly low compared to the European Union (EU). Therefore, it is particularly important to support information flow, raising awareness, and involvement of organizations in RES research and technology demonstration projects. The U.S. currently relies heavily on coal, oil, and natural gas for its energy. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, that is, they draw on finite resources that will eventually dwindle, becoming too expensive or too environmentally damaging to retrieve.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the applications of quantum computing to energy systems optimization problems and discuss some of the challenges faced by quantum computers with techniques to overcome them. The basic concepts underlying quantum computation and their distinctive characteristics in comparison to their classical counterparts are also discussed. Along with different hardware architecture description of two commercially available quantum systems, an example making use of open-source software tools is provided as a first step for diving into the new realm of programming quantum computers for solving systems optimization problems. The trade-off between qualities of these two quantum architectures is also discussed. Complex nature of energy systems due to their structure and large number of design and operational constraints make energy systems optimization a hard problem for most available algorithms. Problems like facility location allocation for energy systems infrastructure development, unit commitment of electric power systems operations, and heat exchanger network synthesis which fall under the category of energy systems optimization are solved using both classical algorithms implemented on conventional CPU based computer and quantum algorithm realized on quantum computing hardware. Their designs, implementation and results are stated. Additionally, this paper describes the limitations of state-of-the-art quantum computers and their great potential to impact the field of energy systems optimization.},

abstract = {Unit Commitment (UC) is an optimization problem used to determine the operation schedule of the generating units at every hour interval with varying loads and generations under different generational, environmental and technical constraints. With the significant increase of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) integration into the power networks, effects posed by these system changes to the UC are actively being studied and investigated by global researchers and operation engineers. To this end, this paper firstly provides a literature survey of UC concept, objectives and constraints. Different UC models developed for addressing RES impacts are also reviewed. Moreover, many algorithms have been proposed in the past few decades to optimize the UC problem. This work explores the necessity for alternative optimization approaches for UC solution. In doing that, the work uncovers the advantages and disadvantages of the existing methodologies so that future algorithms could be designed in retaining the advantages of the existing methodologies while avoiding the presented weaknesses. In addition, installation of energy storage devices to balance the fluctuation in power generation and their associated impacts on UC models are reviewed. The contents of this paper provide ready-to-refer and ready-to-use information for the researchers working in the field of UC.},

It is thus interesting for them to be ready to take advantage of features such as dynamic energy pricing and real-time choice of operators. In this work, we propose a system to monitor and control an office environment and to couple it with the smart grid. The idea is to schedule the operation of devices according to policies defined by the users, in order to minimize the cost of operation while leaving unaffected user comfort and productivity. The implementation of the system and its testing in a living lab environment show interesting economic savings of an average of about 35{\%} and in some cases even overall energy savings in the order of 10{\%} for a building equipped with renewable generation plants, and economic and energy savings of 20{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively, for a building without local renewable installations. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

The flexibility sources, i.e. demand side response, dispatchable power plants, storage and interconnection, can respond to restore that balance. Electric vehicles, including plugin EVs and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), have a huge potential to play an important role in future energy systems. EVs and FCEVs can be used to discharge electricity to the grid, and when aggregating the power of a large number of vehicles, they can function as dispatchable power plants.

Fuel cell cars (FCEVs), while parked, can produce electricity more efficiently than the present electricity system and with useful 'waste' products, heat and fresh water. In terms of technology, the energy production system " Car as Power Plant " can be envisaged as a fleet of fuel cell vehicles, where cars, while parked (over 90 {\%} of the time), can produce with the fuel cell electricity, heat and fresh water that can be feed into the respective grids.

abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

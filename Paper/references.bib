We explore the usefulness of a number of simple quantum circuits as benchmarks for gate-based quantum computing devices and show that circuits performing identity operations are very simple, scalable and sensitive to gate errors and are therefore very well suited for this task.

abstract = {We show that a set of gates that consists of all one-bit quantum gates [U(2)] and the two-bit exclusive-OR gate [that maps Boolean values (x,y) to (x,xy)] is universal in the sense that all unitary operations on arbitrarily many bits n [U(2n)] can be expressed as compositions of these gates. We investigate the number of the above gates required to implement other gates, such as generalized Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2) transformation to one input bit if and only if the logical and of all remaining input bits is satisfied. These gates play a central role in many proposed constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety of two- and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for n-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for arbitrary n-bit unitary operations. {\textcopyright} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This paper introduces basic concepts of annealing-based quantum computing, also known as adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) and quantum annealing (QA), and surveys what is known about this novel computing paradigm. Extensive empirical research on physical quantum annealing processers built by D-Wave Systems has exposed many interesting features and properties. However, because of longstanding differences between abstract and empirical approaches to the study of computational performance, much of this work may not be considered relevant to questions of interest to complexity theory; by the same token, several theoretical results in quantum computing may be considered irrelevant to practical experience. To address this communication gap, this paper proposes models of computation and of algorithms that lie on a scale of instantiation between pencil-and-paper abstraction and physical device. Models at intermediate points on these scales can provide a common language, allowing researchers from both ends to communicate and share their results. The paper also gives several examples of common terms that have different technical meanings in different regions of this highly multidisciplinary field, which can create barriers to effective communication across disciplines.},

abstract = {The variable energy sources drive the need for flexibility to restore a system's energy balance. The flexibility sources, i.e. demand side response, dispatchable power plants, storage and interconnection, can respond to restore that balance. Electric vehicles, including plugin EVs and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), have a huge potential to play an important role in future energy systems. EVs and FCEVs can be used to discharge electricity to the grid, and when aggregating the power of a large number of vehicles, they can function as dispatchable power plants. Plugin EVs can adapt their charging behaviour to the needs of the power system operator, and similarly they can act as storage by charging their batteries for example, when there is a surplus of renewable energy. Fuel cell cars (FCEVs), while parked, can produce electricity more efficiently than the present electricity system and with useful 'waste' products, heat and fresh water. In terms of technology, the energy production system " Car as Power Plant " can be envisaged as a fleet of fuel cell vehicles, where cars, while parked (over 90 {\%} of the time), can produce with the fuel cell electricity, heat and fresh water that can be feed into the respective grids. The Car as Power Plant system with FCEVs has the potential to replace all electricity production power plants, creating a flexible detachable decentralized multimodal energy system. This chapter will address the role of electric mobility in the future energy systems in general and its role in demand response and in flexible generation.},

Therefore, updating of these parameters is a very important issue to further improve the final accuracy of economic dispatch problems. Estimating the parameters of the fuel cost curve may be the best solution for this issue. This paper presents an application of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to estimate the fuel cost curve parameters of thermal power plants. In the estimation problem, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-order fuel cost functions are used, and the estimation problem is formulated as an optimization one. The ABC algorithm is used to solve this optimization problem by minimizing the total error in the estimated parameters. In this study, in order to evaluate the performance of the ABC algorithm, it is tested on 3 different cases that have 3 different fuel cost types, such as coal, oil, and gas. The results obtained from the proposed method are compared with the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and least square error methods reported previously in the literature. The results show that the ABC algorithm is stronger than the others at solving such a problem.},

GAS can provide a quadratic speed-up for combinatorial optimization problems compared to brute force search. However, this requires the development of efficient oracles to represent problems and flag states that satisfy certain search criteria. In general, this can be achieved using quantum arithmetic, however, this is expensive in terms of Toffoli gates as well as required ancilla qubits, which can be prohibitive in the near-term. Within this work, we develop a way to construct efficient oracles to solve CPBO problems using GAS algorithms. We demonstrate this approach and the potential speed-up for the portfolio optimization problem, i.e. a QUBO, using simulation.

Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ‘universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘ complexity ' or ‘ knowledge ' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

Four applications, namely the molecular conformation problem, job-shop scheduling problem, manufacturing cell formation problem, and the vehicle routing problem, are specifically addressed. Large-scale instances of these application problems across multiple scales ranging from molecular design to logistics optimization are computationally challenging for deterministic optimization algorithms on classical computers. To address the computational challenges, hybrid QC-based algorithms are proposed and extensive computational experimental results are presented to demonstrate their applicability and efficiency.

@article{Alrashidi2009,
abstract = {In this article, a new and accurate method for estimating the parameters of thermal power plant fuel-cost function is proposed. The input-output characteristics of thermal power plants are affected by many factors such as the ambient operating temperature and aging of generating units. Thus, periodical estimation of power plant characteristics is very crucial to improve the overall operational and economical practices. The higher the accuracy of the estimated coefficients, the more accurate the results obtained from the economic dispatch and optimal power flow calculations. Different models that describe the input-output relationship of thermal units are considered, including the one that accounts for the valve loading point. The traditional estimation problem is viewed and formulated as an optimization one. The goal is to minimize the total estimation error such that the selected model follows field data measurements as closely as possible. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to minimize the error associated with the estimated parameters. The proposed approach relieves some of the mathematical restrictions typically imposed on system modeling, since it does not require convexity or differentiability, as in the case of many conventional estimation techniques. Various study cases are considered in this work to test the performance of the method. Results obtained are partially compared to those computed by the least error square method. Comparison results are in favor of the particle swarm optimization algorithm in all study cases considered.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a new Big-M reformulation for Generalized Disjunctive Programs. Unlike the traditional Big-M reformulation that uses one M-parameter for each constraint, the new approach uses multiple M-parameters for each constraint. Each of these M-parameters is associated with each alternative in the disjunction to which the constraint belongs. In this way, the proposed MINLP reformulation is at least as tight as the traditional Big-M, and it does not require additional variables or constraints. We present the new Big-M, and analyze the strength in its continuous relaxation compared to that of the traditional Big-M. The new formulation is tested by solving several instances with an NLP-based branch and bound method. The results show that, in most cases, the new reformulation requires fewer nodes and less time to find the optimal solution.},

abstract = {Energy management for residential homes and/or offices requires both identification and prediction of the future usages or service requests of different appliances present in the buildings. The aim of this work is to identify residential appliances from aggregate reading at the smart meter and to predict their states in order to minimize their energy consumption. For this purpose, our work is divided in two distinct modules: Appliance identification and future usage prediction. Both identification and prediction are based on multi-label learners which takes inter-appliance co-relation into account. The first part of the paper concerns the identification of electrical appliance usages from the smart meter monitoring. The main objective is to be able to identify individual loads from the aggregate power consumption in a non-intrusive manner. In this work, high energy consuming appliances are identified at 1-hour sampling rate using novel set of meta-features for this domain. The second part of the paper concerns future usage prediction. A comparison of algorithms for future appliance usage prediction using identification and direct consumption reading is presented. This work is based on a real residential dataset, called IRISE: 100 houses monitored every 10 minutes to one hour during one year (including weather informations). {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the development of smart grid, demand-side resources (DSR) will play an increasingly important role in the power balance of supply and demand. In addition, the requirement of a low-carbon smart grid means some policy backgrounds, such as carbon emissions trading (CET), should not be ignored. Under these circumstances, it is a good idea to construct a novel unit commitment (UC) model. This paper proposes a model that not only takes advantage of various resources on the demand side, such as electric vehicles, demand response, and distributed generation, but also reflects the effects of CET on generation schedule. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is applied to solve the problem. In numerical studies, we analyze the impacts of DSR and CET on the results of UC, respectively. In addition, two meaningful experiments are conducted to study the approaches to allocate emission quotas and the effects of price transmission mechanism.},

abstract = {The variable energy sources drive the need for flexibility to restore a system's energy balance. The flexibility sources, i.e. demand side response, dispatchable power plants, storage and interconnection, can respond to restore that balance. Electric vehicles, including plugin EVs and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), have a huge potential to play an important role in future energy systems. EVs and FCEVs can be used to discharge electricity to the grid, and when aggregating the power of a large number of vehicles, they can function as dispatchable power plants. Plugin EVs can adapt their charging behaviour to the needs of the power system operator, and similarly they can act as storage by charging their batteries for example, when there is a surplus of renewable energy. Fuel cell cars (FCEVs), while parked, can produce electricity more efficiently than the present electricity system and with useful 'waste' products, heat and fresh water. In terms of technology, the energy production system " Car as Power Plant " can be envisaged as a fleet of fuel cell vehicles, where cars, while parked (over 90 {\%} of the time), can produce with the fuel cell electricity, heat and fresh water that can be feed into the respective grids. The Car as Power Plant system with FCEVs has the potential to replace all electricity production power plants, creating a flexible detachable decentralized multimodal energy system. This chapter will address the role of electric mobility in the future energy systems in general and its role in demand response and in flexible generation.},

@article{Abujarad2017,
abstract = {Unit Commitment (UC) is an optimization problem used to determine the operation schedule of the generating units at every hour interval with varying loads and generations under different generational, environmental and technical constraints. With the significant increase of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) integration into the power networks, effects posed by these system changes to the UC are actively being studied and investigated by global researchers and operation engineers. To this end, this paper firstly provides a literature survey of UC concept, objectives and constraints. Different UC models developed for addressing RES impacts are also reviewed. Moreover, many algorithms have been proposed in the past few decades to optimize the UC problem. This work explores the necessity for alternative optimization approaches for UC solution. In doing that, the work uncovers the advantages and disadvantages of the existing methodologies so that future algorithms could be designed in retaining the advantages of the existing methodologies while avoiding the presented weaknesses. In addition, installation of energy storage devices to balance the fluctuation in power generation and their associated impacts on UC models are reviewed. The contents of this paper provide ready-to-refer and ready-to-use information for the researchers working in the field of UC.},

abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

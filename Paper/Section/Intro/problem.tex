\section{The Unit Commitment Problem}

The Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) generally is concerned with the scheduling of thermal power plants.
Where thermal power plants can be coal, oil, gas or nuclear power plants.
The commitment of the power plants should be scheduled in such a way, that the fuel cost is minimized.
Other than minimizing a cost function, the problem also consideres various constraints of the power plants.
Such as minimum and maximum power output.
\cite{Baldick1995}

The problem is often mathematically formulated as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP).
MINLP is a class of optimization problems, with a non-linear objective funtion, integer and floating-point variables,
as well as various constraints on the variables.
These models are non-convex in the case of the UCP, due to the binary nature of the commitment variables $u_{i, t}$.

\section{The Unit Commitment Problem}

The Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) generally is concerned with the scheduling of thermal power plants.
Where thermal power plants can be coal, oil, gas or nuclear power plants.
The commitment of the power plants should be scheduled in such a way, that the fuel cost is minimized
while fulfilling the demand of power.
The fuel cost depends on the power output $p_{i, t}$ as well as start-up and shut-down costs.
While minimizing the cost function, the problem also consideres various constraints of the power plants.
These include meeting the power demand,
ramping constraints of each plant,
the minimum and maximum power output of each plant
and the minimum up- and down-time.

The problem is often mathematically formulated as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP).
MINLP is a class of optimization problems, with a non-linear objective funtion, integer and floating-point variables,
as well as various constraints on the variables.
These models are non-convex in the case of the UCP, due to the binary nature of the commitment variables $u_{i, t}$.

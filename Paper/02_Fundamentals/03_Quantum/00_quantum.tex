\section{Quantum Computing}
\label{fundamentals:quantum}

Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) instead of bits that classical computers use.
While a bit can be either in the state $0$ or $1$, a qubit can be in a so-called superposition of two states.
States of qubits are generally written using the Dirac-Notation, also known as the Bra-Ket-Notation.
The two states, the superposition is a combination of, are called the basis.
The most basic basis is the basis $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$.
The formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition}) describes such a superposition.
When one measures the state of the qubit, it collapses into one of the base states, which is the measurement result.
The probability of either basis state being measured is the absolute square of the complex amplitude of the basic state in the superposition.
Formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition.probability}) shows this for the state $\ket{0}$~\cite{Vedral1998}.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \ket{\phi} & = \alpha \cdot \ket{0} + \beta \cdot \ket{1}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
    \alpha \\ \beta
  \end{pmatrix}
  & \text{with } \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}, \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 1
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition}
  \\
  p_0 & = |\alpha|^2
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition.probability}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Multiple qubits chained together form a quantum register.
In such a register, multiple qubits might be entangled.
That means that the measurement of one qubit depends on the measurement of the other qubit.
The formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition.register}) describes a quantum register with $n$ qubits.
If one can't separate the formula into single qubits, the state is entangled.
The probability of measuring a specific state of the quantum register is given by the absolute square of the amplitude of that state
Formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition.register.probability}) shoes this for all states $\ket{x}$~\cite{Vedral1998}.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \ket{\Phi} & = \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \alpha_x \cdot \ket{x}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
    \alpha_{0 \ldots 00} \\ \alpha_{0 \ldots 01} \\ \alpha_{0 \ldots 10} \\ \ldots \\ \alpha_{1 \ldots 11}
  \end{pmatrix}
  & \text{with } \forall x \in \{0, 1\}^n: \alpha_x \in \mathbb{C},
  \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \alpha_x^2 = 1
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition.register}
  \\
  p_x & = \alpha_x^2
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition.register.probability}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{State of the art}

\subsubsection{Annealing-based Quantum Computers}

D-Wave is the leading manufacturer of annealing-based quantum computers.
Their newest model, ``Advantage'', has over $5, 000$ qubits and over $35, 000$ couplers.
The connectors connect the qubits in a $P_{16}$-Graph, also called ``Pegasus''.
This graph has the degree $16$, which means that every qubit has a connection with $15$ other qubits.
D-Wave released this model in 2020~\cite{D-Wave2020, Zbinden2020}.

The model before this, ``2000Q'', has over $2, 000$ qubits and over $6, 000$ couplers.
The connectors connect the qubits in a $C_{16}$-Graph, also called ``Chimera''.
This graph has the degree $6$, which means that every qubit has a connection with $5$ other qubits.
D-wave released that model in 2017~\cite{D-Wave2020, Zbinden2020}.

D-wave, therefore, increased their qubit number significantly in the last years.
The qubit count increased by $150\%$ in just $3$ years.
The coupler count increased by $580\%$ in the same time frame, although this number is misleading.
The more meaningful metric anout the coupler count is the qubit connectivity, the so-called ``degree'', which increased by $133\%$.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figure:annealing.processors.history} shows the increase of the number of qubits that are in D-Wave's QPUs.
The number of qubits doubles all $2$ years.

\subsubsection{Gate-based Quantum Computers}

IBM is the leading manufacturer of Gate-based Quantum Computers.
Their newest model, ``Hummingbird'', has exactly $65$ qubits.
It debuted in 2020.
Unfortunately, information about the performance of this processor is not available to the public~\cite{IBMRoadmap2020}.

The model before that, ``Falcon'', has exactly $27$ qubits.
It debuted in 2019.
IBM was able to achieve a quantum volume of $64$ on this processor~\cite{IBMRoadmap2020}.

Quantum volume is a metric that characterizes the power of quantum processors.
It depends on the number of qubits and the number of gates that a quantum circuit can have without producing significant errors~\cite{Bishop2017}.
IBM managed to achieve a $100\%$ increase of the quantum volume metric every year since 2017~\cite{IBMqv2020}.
This is illustrated in figure \ref{figure:gate.qv.history}.

Even though the quantum volume is an improved measurement of the power of a quantum processor, the number of qubits is still important.
It determines how big the problems can be for the quantum processor to solve them.
IBM promises at least a doubling of the qubit count every year in their 2020 roadmap.
It projects its 2023 quantum processors to have $1, 121$ qubits.
Figure \ref{figure:gate.qbits.projection} ilustrates the projected qubit count~\cite{IBMRoadmap2020}.

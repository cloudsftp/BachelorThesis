The proposed approach using a hybrid annealing-based DQM sampler demonstrates a huge computation time advantage over the classical optimization algorithm.
This work shows that advantage by running experiments for optimizing real-world like UCP scenarios.
But even though this approach is much faster for large inputs, it also produces non-optimal solutions.
The error increases with the size of the UCPs.

Optimizing UCPs in the size as this work considers is not possible with purely quantum algorithms.
Both the annealing-based quantum computers and the gate-based quantum computers do not have the resources to tackle QUBOs of this size yet.
While annealing-based QPUs only lack the connectivity of their qubits with one another, the gate-based quantum computers are far from achieving the needed number of qubits.

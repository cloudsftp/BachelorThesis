\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Unit Commitment Problem as Discrete Quadratic Model}

The conversion of the MINLP formulation of the UCP to a DQM formulation is not optimal.
In the conversion, the ability to find a true optimum to the UCP is lost.
This is shown experimentally in section \ref{validation:comparison}.

There might be a better way to formulate a DQM for the UCP.
If there is one with a comparable number of variables and biases, the same computational advantage as demonstrated in section \ref{validation:comparison} would be achieved while finding the true optimal solution.

\subsection{Hybrid Mixed-integer Non-linear Problem Solver}

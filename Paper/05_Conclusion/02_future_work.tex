\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Unit Commitment Problem as Discrete Quadratic Model}

The conversion of the MINLP formulation of the UCP to a DQM formulation is not optimal.
In the conversion, the ability to find a true optimum to the UCP is lost.
This is shown experimentally in section \ref{validation:comparison}.

There might be a better way to formulate a DQM for the UCP.
If there is one with a comparable number of variables and biases, the same computational advantage as demonstrated in section \ref{validation:comparison} would be achieved while finding the true optimal solution.

\subsection{Hybrid Mixed-integer Non-linear Problem Solver}

Another promising approach is to find a hybrid algorithm for optimizing MINLP problems directly.
Then the reformulation as a DQM would not be nescessary while achieving a computational advantage over purely classical algorithms.
\citeauthor{Ajagekar2020} demonstrated hyprid algorithms for similar mathematical optimization problems like the Mixed-integer Linear Problem (MILP).
\cite{Ajagekar2020}

Such a genreral purpose hybrid MINLP solver would not only help the energy industry, but also many other industries.
Most real-world industry problems can be formulated as a MINLP.
\cite{Belotti2009}
Thus most real-world industry problems could be solved using such a hybrid MINLP solver.

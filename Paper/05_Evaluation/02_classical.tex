\section{Performance of Classical Computers}

For the optimization of the Pyomo model, the Pyomo library runs a standard solver.
It formulates the problem in the mathematical modeling language AMPL
and calls a solver to optimize it.
The solver returns the solution, which Pyomo then reads~\cite{PyomoAMPL}.

This work uses the open-source solver Couenne for classical optimizations.
COIN-OR built this solver.
Couenne is short for ``Convex Over and Under ENvelopes for Nonlinear Estimation''.
It can find global minima of nonconvex MINLPs like the one that this work considers.
It is a branch and bound algorithm and utilizes linearization, bound reduction, and branching methods~\cite{Belotti2009, CoinorHome, CouenneRepo}.

This work performs the classical optimizations on the Excess Cluster of the HLRS, Stuttgart~\cite{ExcessHLRS, HLRS}.

The optimization of the problem is of high time complexity.
In the beginning, with small inputs, it takes little time.
As listed in table \ref{table:evaluation.classical.performance}, the optimization of $4$ power plants with $2$ units of time takes about $0.5$ seconds.
But as the input size grows, the time needed by the solver grows exponentially.
When the input size is doubled --- $4$ plants over $4$ units of time --- the optimization takes about $3.5$ seconds.
After adding another $2$ units of time, the optimization takes $15.5$ seconds.

As the number of inputs grows large, the optimization grows even faster than exponentially.
With a worst-case projection of the first $4$ data points, the time needed for optimization should multiply by $7$ with every additional $2$ units of time.
That means that the optimization of $4$ power plants over $14$ units of time should take about $0.5 \cdot 7^6 \approx 58,824$ seconds.
But the data shows that it took about $311,144.9$ seconds.

The diagram \ref{figure:evaluation.classical.performance} highlights the fast growing computation time needed for the optimization.
Only the last two data points are distinguishable from the first data points because their computation time is very long compared to the first data points.
It shows the time needed for optimization dependent on the input size --- the number of time instances.

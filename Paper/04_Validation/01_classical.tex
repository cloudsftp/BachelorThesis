\section{Performance of Classical Computers}

For the optimization of the Pyomo model, the Pyomo library runs a standard solver.
It formulates the problem in the mathematical modeling language AMPL
and calls a solver to optimize it.
The solver returns the solution which is then read by Pyomo.
\cite{PyomoAMPL}

The solver that is used in this paper is called Couenne and was built by COIN-OR.
Couenne is short for ''Convex Over and Under ENvelopes for Nonlinear Estimation''.
It can find global minima of nonconvex MINLPs like the one that is formulated above.
It is a branch and bound algorithm and utilizes linearization, bound reduction, and branching methods.

The optimizations are performed on the Excess Cluster of the HLRS, Stuttgart.

\section{Performance of Classical Computers}

For the optimization of the Pyomo model, the Pyomo library runs a standard solver.
It formulates the problem in the mathematical modeling language AMPL
and calls a solver to optimize it.
The solver returns the solution, which is then read by Pyomo.
\cite{PyomoAMPL}

The solver that is used in this paper is called Couenne and was built by COIN-OR.
Couenne is short for ''Convex Over and Under ENvelopes for Nonlinear Estimation''.
It can find global minima of nonconvex MINLPs like the one that is formulated above.
It is a branch and bound algorithm and utilizes linearization, bound reduction, and branching methods.

The optimizations are performed on the Excess Cluster of the HLRS, Stuttgart.
\cite{ExcessHLRS,HLRS}

The optimization of the problem is of high time complexity.
In the beginning, with small inputs, it takes little time.
As listed in table \ref{table:evaluation.classical.performance}, the optimization of $4$ power plants with $2$ units of time takes about $0.5$ seconds.
But as the input size grows, the time needed by the solver grows exponentially.
When the input size is doubled --- $4$ plants over $4$ units of time --- the optimization takes about $3.5$ seconds.
After adding another $2$ units of time, the optimization takes $15.5$ seconds.

As the number of inputs grows large, the optimization grows even faster than exponentially.
With a worst-case projection of the first $4$ data points, the time needed for optimization should multiply by $7$ with every additional $2$ units of time.
That means that the optimization of $4$ power plants over $14$ units of time should take about $0.5 \cdot 7^6 \approx 58,824$ seconds.
But the data shows that it took about $311,144.9$ seconds.

The diagram \ref{figure:evaluation.classical.performance} highlights the exponential nature of the optimization of the problem.
It shows the time needed for optimization dependent on the input size --- the number of units of time.

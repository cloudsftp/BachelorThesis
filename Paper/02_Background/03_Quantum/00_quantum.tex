\section{Quantum Computing}

Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) instead of normal bits that classical computers use.
While a bit can be either in the state $0$ or $1$, a qubit can be in a so-called superposition of two states.
States of qubits are generally written using the Dirac-Notation, also known as the Bra-Ket-Notation
The two states, the superposition is a combination of, are called the basis.
The most basic basis is the basis $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$.
The formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition}) describes such a superposition.
When one measures the state of the qubit, it collapses into one of the base states, which is the result of the measurement.
The probability of either basis state being measured is the square of the the complex amplitude of the basis state in the superposition.
\cite{Vedral1998}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition}
  \ket{\phi} & = \alpha \cdot \ket{0} + \beta \cdot \ket{1}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
    \alpha \\ \beta
  \end{pmatrix}
  & \text{with } \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}, \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 1
  \\
  p_0 & = \alpha^2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Multiple qubits chained together form a quantum register.
In such a register, the measurement results of one qubit might depend on the measurement results of other qubits.
This is called entanglement.
The formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition.register}) describes a quantum register with $n$ qubits.
If one can't separate the formula into single qubits, the state is entangled.
The probability of measuring a specific state of the quantum register is given by the amplitude of that state squared.
\cite{Vedral1998}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition.register}
  \ket{\Phi} & = \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \alpha_x \cdot \ket{x}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
    \alpha_{0 \ldots 00} \\ \alpha_{0 \ldots 01} \\ \alpha_{0 \ldots 10} \\ \ldots \\ \alpha_{1 \ldots 11}
  \end{pmatrix}
  & \text{with } \forall x \in \{0, 1\}^n: \alpha_x \in \mathbb{C},
  \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \alpha_x^2 = 1
  \\
  p_x & = \alpha_x^2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{State of the art}

\subsubsection{Annealing-based Quantum Computers}

D-Wave is the leading manufacturer of Quantum Annealers.
Their newest model, ''Advantage'', has over $5, 000$ qubits and over $35, 000$ couplers.
The connectors connect the qubits in a $P_{16}$-Graph, also called ''Pegasus''.
This graph has the degree $16$, which means that every qubit has a connection with $16$ other qubits.
D-Wave released this model in 2020.
\cite{D-Wave2020, Zbinden2020}

The model before this, ''2000Q'', has over $2, 000$ qubits and over $6, 000$ couplers.
The connectors connect the qubits in a $C_{16}$-Graph, also called ''Chimera''.
This graph has the degree $6$, which means that every qubit has a connection with $6$ other qubits.
D-wave released that model in 2017.
\cite{D-Wave2020, Zbinden2020}

D-wave, therefore, increased their qubit number significantly in the last years.
The qubit count increased by $150\%$ in just $3$ years.
The coupler count increased by $580\%$ in the same time frame, although this number is misleading.
The more important metric is the qubit connectivity, the so-called ''degree'', which increased by $133\%$.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figure:annealing.processors.history} shows the increase of the number of qubits that are in D-Waves QPUs.
The number of qubits doubles every $2$ years.
These numbers remind of Moore's Law that dictated the advances in classical computing up until recently.

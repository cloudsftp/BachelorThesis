\section{Quantum Computing}

Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) instead of normal bits that classical computers use.
While a bit can be either in the state $0$ or $1$, a qubit can be in a so-called superposition of two states.
States of qubits are generally written using the Dirac-Notation, also known as the Bra-Ket-Notation
The two states, the superposition is a combination of, are called the basis.
The most basic basis is the basis $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$.
The formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition}) describes such a superposition.
When one measures the state of the qubit, it collapses into one of the base states, which is the result of the measurement.
The probability of either basis state being measured is the square of the the complex amplitude of the basis state in the superposition.
\cite{Vedral1998}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition}
  & \ket{\phi} = \alpha \cdot \ket{0} + \beta \cdot \ket{1}
  & \text{with } \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}, \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 1
  \\
  & P(\ket{0}) = \alpha^2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

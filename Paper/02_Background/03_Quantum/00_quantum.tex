\section{Quantum Computing}

Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) instead of normal bits that classical computers use.
While a bit can be either in the state $0$ or $1$, a qubit can be in a so-called superposition of two states.
States of qubits are generally written using the Dirac-Notation, also known as the Bra-Ket-Notation
The two states, the superposition is a combination of, are called the basis.
The most basic basis is the basis $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$.
The formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition}) describes such a superposition.
When one measures the state of the qubit, it collapses into one of the base states, which is the result of the measurement.
The probability of either basis state being measured is the square of the the complex amplitude of the basis state in the superposition.
\cite{Vedral1998}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition}
  \ket{\phi} & = \alpha \cdot \ket{0} + \beta \cdot \ket{1}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
    \alpha \\ \beta
  \end{pmatrix}
  & \text{with } \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}, \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 1
  \\
  p_0 & = \alpha^2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Multiple qubits chained together form a quantum register.
In such a register, the measurement results of one qubit might depend on the measurement results of other qubits.
This is called entanglement.
The formula (\ref{formula:quantum.superposition.register}) describes a quantum register with $n$ qubits.
If one can't separate the formula into single qubits, the state is entangled.
The probability of measuring a specific state of the quantum register is given by the amplitude of that state squared.
\cite{Vedral1998}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \label{formula:quantum.superposition.register}
  \ket{\Phi} & = \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \alpha_x \cdot \ket{x}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
    \alpha_{0 \ldots 00} \\ \alpha_{0 \ldots 01} \\ \alpha_{0 \ldots 10} \\ \ldots \\ \alpha_{1 \ldots 11}
  \end{pmatrix}
  & \text{with } \forall x \in \{0, 1\}^n: \alpha_x \in \mathbb{C},
  \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \alpha_x^2 = 1
  \\
  p_x & = \alpha_x^2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{State of the art}

\subsubsection{Annealing-based Quantum Computers}

D-Wave is the leading manufacturer of Quantum Annealers.
Their newest model, ''Advantage'', has over $5, 000$ qubits and over $35, 000$ couplers.
The connectors connect the qubits in a $P_{16}$-Graph, also called ''Pegasus''.
This graph has the degree $16$, which means that every qubit has a connection with $16$ other qubits.
D-Wave released this model in 2020.
\cite{D-Wave2020, Zbinden2020}

The model before this, ''2000Q'', has over $2, 000$ qubits and over $6, 000$ couplers.
The connectors connect the qubits in a $C_{16}$-Graph, also called ''Chimera''.
This graph has the degree $6$, which means that every qubit has a connection with $6$ other qubits.
D-wave released that model in 2017.
\cite{D-Wave2020, Zbinden2020}

D-wave, therefore, increased their qubit number significantly in the last years.
The qubit count increased by $150\%$ in just $3$ years.
The coupler count increased by $580\%$ in the same time frame, although this number is misleading.
The more important metric is the qubit connectivity, the so-called ''degree'', which increased by $133\%$.

  \label{figure:annealing.processors.history}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figure:annealing.processors.history} shows the increase of the number of qubits that are in D-Wave's QPUs.
The number of qubits doubles every $2$ years.

\subsubsection{Gate-based Quantum Computers}

IBM is the leading manufacturer of Gate-based Quantum Computers.
Their newest model, ''Hummingbird'', has exactly $65$ qubits.
It debuted in 2020.
Unfortunately, information about the performance of this processor is not available to the public.
\cite{IBMRoadmap2020}

The model before that, ''Falcon'', has exactly $27$ qubits.
It debuted in 2019.
IBM was able to achieve a quantum volume of $64$ on this processor.
\cite{IBMRoadmap2020}

Quantum volume is a metric that characterizes the power of quantum processors.
It depends on the number of qubits and the number of gates that can be applied to the qubits without significant error.
\cite{Bishop2017}
IBM managed to achieve a $100\%$ increase of the quantum volume metric every year since 2017.
\cite{IBMqv2020}
This is illustrated in figure \ref{figure:gate.qv.history}.

Even though the quantum volume is a better measurement of the power of a quantum processor, the number of qubits is still important.
It determines how big the problems can be for the quantum processor to solve them.
IBM promises at least a doubling of the qubit count every year in their 2020 roadmap.
It projects its 2023 quantum processors to have $1, 121$ qubits.
Figure \ref{figure:gate.qbits.projection} ilustrates the projected qubit count.
\cite{IBMRoadmap2020}

\subsubsection{Moore's Law}

The number of qubits in D-Wave's quantum processors and the projected number of qubits in IBM's quantum processors grow exponentially.
This is visualized in figures \ref{figure:annealing.processors.history} and \ref{figure:gate.qbits.projection}.
Also, the quantum volume of IBM's quantum processors grew exponentially in the last years.
This is visualized figure \ref{figure:gate.qv.history}.

This exponential growth reminds of Moore's Law.
This law states that the computing power of classical computers grows exponentially.
More precisely, it doubles every two years.
This law was accurate until recently.
The industry is close to a physical limit, where it can not fit more transistors into the same space due to quantum tunneling.
\cite{Theis2017, Ferain2011}

If D-Wave continues to improve its quantum processors as in recent years, its quantum processors will improve similarly to classical computers in the last $5$ decades.
If IBM holds their promises of the 2020 roadmap, its quantum processors will improve twice as fast as classical computers in the last $5$ decades.

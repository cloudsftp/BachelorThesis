\subsection{Unit Commtiment Problem}

Many methods for optimizing the UCP described in section \ref{backg:ucp} exist in the literature.
Abujarad et al. \cite{Abujarad2017} listed and compared those methods.
They listed the use of Mixed-integer Linear Programming as accurate but exponentially expensive.
All other methods give a sub-optimal solution.

When dealing with cost functions of thermal power plants, they seldom are linear.
Most commonly, they are quadratic.
Baldick \cite{Baldick1995} generalized the formulation of the UCP as Mixed-integer Non-linear Problems, where he assumed a quadratic cost function.
